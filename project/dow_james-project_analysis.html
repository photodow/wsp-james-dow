			<h1>Site Intent</h1>
			<article>
				<h2>The Current Website Goals</h2>
				<p>The Tampa Bay Beaches current website is being used as a hub, so visitors from all over the world can discover and plan their vacation to Tampa before they step foot out of their home. It tells the visitor what beaches are close by, events going on, local businesses, and more.  It is also very helpful with location so you can plan the perfect vacation where everything you need is close by.</p>

				<p>It also has a section for consumers looking to move into the area near a beach. It gives them an idea of what to expect, where to start, and where they can find real estate for sale near the beach. It even helps you get started with finding employment if you aren’t already set in that area.</p>

				<p>Finally, since the site is run by the Chamber of Commerce, the website has a section devoted just to that. Allowing users to login and new users to sign up. It has messages from the members, information on how to contact them and a calendar to keep people up to date on what’s going on.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>The New Website Goals</h2>
				<p>The new website needs to be focused more towards the goal of vacation planning. Beaches and local business get most of their revenue around vacation season. I don’t think we should get rid of either the relocation section, or the chamber of commerce section, but they should fall more into the background, especially the Chamber of Commerce section because it doesn’t help the consumer much at all. Rather, it helps the client, who should already know the ins and outs of the site because they visit it more frequently.</p>

			<h1>Competitor Analysis</h1>
			<article>
				<h2>Miami Beaches</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.miamibeachfl.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.miamibeachfl.gov/</a><br />
		The Miami Beach website appears to have a large flow of traffic, but it appears to mostly be college girls specifically looking for Miami Beach. Since Miami is such a large, and popular city in the state of Florida it cuts heavily into the Tampa Beach revenue. Since most users appear to already know what they are looking for when they are searching for Miami Beach, this leaves open an opportunity to rank higher in the general Florida Beach search terms where people aren’t sure where they want to go yet.</p>

				<div class="analytics">
					<h3>Traffic Rank</h3>
					<p>76,228</p>

					<h3>Audience Snapshot</h3>
					<p>Based on internet averages, miamibeachfl.gov is visited more frequently by females who are in the age range 55-64, have no children, and are college educated.</p>

				<h2>Daytona Beach</h2>
				<p><a href="http://daytonabeach.com/whattosee.cfm" target="_blank">http://daytonabeach.com/whattosee.cfm</a><br />
		Daytona Beach is more attracted to older women. Their website appears to get more traffic then the Tampa Bay Beaches website, but again people go into it already knowing where they want to go. This again leaves a large opportunity for Tampa Bay Beaches to help people decide who are undecided.</p>

				<div class="analytics">
					<h3>Traffic Rank</h3>
					<p>140,472</p>

					<h3>Audience Snapshot</h3>
					<p>Based on internet averages, daytonabeach.com is visited more frequently by females who are in the age range 35-44 and received some college education.</p>

				<h2>Cocoa Beach</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.cocoabeach.com/index1.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.cocoabeach.com/index1.shtml</a><br />
		Cocoa Beach attracts more families specifically the mother in the family. They have a well designed website that appeals to a female and kids. Although it may be a little more attractive in aesthetics, it does tend to be a little more confusing and busy. Like the three competitors before this one, they’re consumers already know what beach they want to go to. This again leaves Tampa Bay Beaches an opportunity to reach into the general Florida Beach search key words allowing us the opportunity to help convince the confused consumer to visit Tampa Beaches.</p>

She is not sure where she wants to go, but her friend Terresa, who read’s Melody’s blogger site, suggested the West coast due to calmer waters.
