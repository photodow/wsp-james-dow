<h2>Site Intent</h2>
<h3>The Original Website Goals</h3>
<p>The Tampa Bay Beaches current website is being used as a hub, so visitors from all over the world can discover and plan their vacation to Tampa before they step foot out of their home. It tells the visitor what beaches are close by, events going on, local businesses, and more. It is also very helpful with location so you can plan the perfect vacation where everything you need is close by.</p>
<p>It also has a section for consumers looking to move into the area near a beach. It gives them an idea of what to expect, where to start, and where they can find real estate for sale near the beach. It even helps you get started with finding employment if you aren’t already set in that area.</p>
<p>Finally, since the site is run by the Chamber of Commerce, the website has a section devoted just to that. Allowing users to login and new users to sign up. It has messages from the members, information on how to contact them and a calendar to keep people up to date on what’s going on.</p>
<h3>The New Website Goals</h3>
<p>The new website needs to be focused more towards the goal of vacation planning. Beaches and local business get most of their revenue around vacation season. I don’t think we should get rid of either the relocation section, or the chamber of commerce section, but they should fall more into the background, especially the Chamber of Commerce section because it doesn’t help the consumer much at all. Rather, it helps the client, who should already know the ins and outs of the site because they visit it more frequently.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<h3>Allison Gertrude</h3>
<p>Allison is a 36 year old stay at home mom with an Associates of Arts degree in Liberal Studies. With her husband and 3 kids, she is looking to find the perfect beach to help her husband relax from his full time job. She is not sure where she wants to go, but her friend Terresa, who read’s Melody’s blogger site, suggested the West coast due to calmer waters. Melody isn’t a computer genius by any means, but she understands the basic functions of a website, and can find her way around the Internet without any problems.</p>
<h3>Marissa Porter</h3>
<p>Marissa is a 40 year old writer from Atlanta, Georgia. She has a degree in communications and writes from home as a freelance writer for various news websites and blogs. She is divorced with a 10 year old daughter who is her best friend. She is in the middle of a mid-	life crisis and needs to get away from her writing for a little while. She’s not sure where she wants to go, but remembers how nice her last vacation to Florida was when she was in college.</p>
